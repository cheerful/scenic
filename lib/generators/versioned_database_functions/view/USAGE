Description:
  Create a new database view for your application. This will create a new
  view definition file and the accompanying migration.

  If a view of the given name already exists, create a new version of the view
  and a migration to replace the old version with the new.

  To create a materialized view, pass the '--materialized' option.

Examples:
    rails generate versioned_database_functions:view searches

      create: db/views/searches_v01.sql
      create: db/migrate/20140803191158_create_searches.rb

    rails generate versioned_database_functions:view searches

      create: db/views/searches_v02.sql
      create: db/migrate/20140804191158_update_searches_to_version_2.rb
